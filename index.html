    <h2>Welcome to the culinary mind of Nathaniel</h2>
    <p>This website is designed to help each and every person understand the importance of simplicity in the human diet</p>
    <p>There was a study done by a high school teacher who made the claim that the type and quality of food does not have affect the body nearly as much as the amount of calories taken in.  The teacher followed a strict diet of 1800 Calories of Zebra Cakes per day.  After a few months, he had lost 20 pounds and his good lipoprotein levels had increased, while the bad decreased.</p>
    <p>In my opinion, the big message with which we are left is the importance of internalizing the attitude self-control: We can munch our hearts away until there's too much of us left, or we can understand that we can be who we are and embrace our own patterns of food-eating habits, while simultaneously having the ability to control our own destinies, body-images, and possibly even self-esteem.  Not to say that there is one correct way of eating or that everyone should eat 1800 calories per day, but rather that the paths to goals that we may crave are not as far as we may think.</p>
