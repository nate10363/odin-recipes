    <h2>Eggs are the source of life, and non-processed rice will help support those healthy, keto free brain functions</h2>
    <p>As subscribers to the living life, we should be eating life itself in our efforts to maintain our bodies as nature intended.  For a long time, I was on and off vegan/vegetarian.  For many years, I was constantly sick.  It was so bad that I was essentially never not sick.  After years of this torture, I decided to eat an egg heavy diet, about 7 to 8 per day, without regards to high cholesterol levels.  I found that after a few weeks, without a sinlge change to anything else in my life, I miraculously stopped being sick.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with the vegan/vegetarian lifestyle, but I would recommend to anyone with bodily issues to give this a try :)</p>
