    <h2 class="top">A delicious, cold dish as prepared by Nate</h2>
    <p>Time has proven itself vital in Nate's many iterations of his ever-evolving cereal recipe.  Trial and effort has landed us with the best way to prepare and eat this delicacy: precuriously placed bananas and peanut butter </p>
    <h3 class="is"><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <p><em>Ingredient measurements are changeable to one's own liking</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups cereal of choice (prefereably Honey Nut Cheerios or Frosted Flakes</li>
        <li>1 liter almond milk, vanilla unsweetended</li>
        <li>1 large banana</li>
        <1i>1 jar of Skippy's Creamy Peanut Butter</li>
        <li>1 extra large bowl</li>
        <li>1 very normal sized spoon</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
    <h3 class="is"><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
    <p><em>Every step is incredibly important in its own order.  Be sure to follow exactly</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bowl at the location where the cereal will be eaten</li>
        <li>Take all 5 cups of cereal and pour into bowl</li>
        <li>On the side, take two thirds of the length-wise banana peel off, and place it on your eating surface</li>
        <li>Pour your almondmilk into the cereal bowl</li>
        <li>You are now ready to eat your cereal!</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>As you are eating the cereal, take your spoon and cut a slice of your banana.  Use that banana-filled spoon and scoop up some cereal.  You'll find that the almond milk creates an amazing surface texture on the cut edges of the banana</li>
        <li>An amazing tip is also to put a bit of your Skippy's creamy peanut butter on the tip of your spoon.  Scoop up more cereal with your peanut butter spoon</li>
        <li>If you desire, cut a piece of banana and put it to the side.  Scoop up a bit of peanut butter, and place the banana on top of the peanut butter, and scoop up some cereal</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Congratulations!!  You have now eaten the most delicious cereal ever</h2>
