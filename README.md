# odin-recipes

The purpose of this project is to display that I have effectively absorbed the HTML elements presented by TOP up until this point of the Foundations course.  This is without any known elements of CSS or Javascript, but nonetheless is to show a working knowledge of placing information onto a page in an orderly fashion



Now that I've finished the first real project of TOP and have actually dug into software development, I can say that I really enjoy it.  Going over the lessons might be a bit boring at times, but once I get to the projects, the time just flies by.  Seeing everything change once I press the reload button brings up emotions that I didn't know I had, and through all of the challenges and everything, they're as strong as the first reload.  Writing this only makes me more excited to continue onto the next lesson, making me wonder why I haven't done this sooner.
